<!-- This flags file is both an example for the SPEC CPU2017 documentation and a useful flags file for results with GCC.

................ You will want a nice wide window when reading this file ........................................................ 

     The first three lines at the top must be exactly as shown.  They claim that the file conforms to the DTD (Document Type
     Description) at the listed URL.  Results submitted to SPEC must use a well-formed flags file.  You can check your XML using
     a validating parser such as RXP, http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html, also included in your kit as 'specrxp'.  See:
         http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/utility.html#specrxp.
     Or, you can use an on-line parser, such as: 
         http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html
         http://validator.w3.org/

     When results are displayed at www.spec.org, the XML file is transformed to HTML (using 'flags_dump', which is on your kit).
     You should ALSO validate the HTML version, which can be done at:
        http://validator.w3.org/

                A complete (.rsf) result includes one or more embedded flags files.  When an embedded flags file is extracted, it 
                will need a name.  The next line tells the tools what name to use when extracting.  -->

              All flag descriptions MUST have a title.  It'll be used as the page title for the full HTML version, and as for 
              page headings in HTML reports.  -->

              for elements in your flag descriptions, you may put it here.  As the contents should be HTML, it will save lots of

   <p>SPECrate runs might use one of these methods to bind processes to specific processors, depending on the config file.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><p>Linux systems: the <tt>numactl</tt> command is commonly used.     Here is a brief guide to understanding the specific
            command which will be found in the config file: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>syntax: <tt>numactl [--interleave=nodes] [--preferred=node] [--physcpubind=cpus] [--cpunodebind=nodes]
                  [--membind=nodes] [--localalloc] command args ...</tt></li>
            <li><tt>numactl</tt> runs processes with a specific NUMA scheduling or memory placement policy.  The policy is set for a
               command and inherited by all of its children. </li>
            <li><tt>--localalloc</tt> instructs numactl to keep a process memory on the local node while <tt>-m</tt> specifies which node(s) to
               place a process memory.  </li>
            <li><tt>--physcpubind</tt> specifies which core(s) to bind the process. In this case, copy 0 is bound to processor 0
               etc.</li>
            <li> For full details on using numactl, please refer to your Linux documentation, <tt>man numactl</tt></li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Solaris systems: The <tt>pbind</tt> command is commonly used, via  
            <br /> <b><kbd>submit=echo 'pbind -b...' > dobmk; sh dobmk</kbd></b> <br />
            The specific command may be found in the config file; here is a brief guide to understanding that command: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><kbd><b>submit=</b></kbd> causes the SPEC tools to use this line when submitting jobs.</li>
            <li><kbd><b>echo ...&gt; dobmk</b></kbd> causes the generated commands to be written to a file, namely
               <kbd>dobmk</kbd>.</li>
            <li><p><kbd><b>pbind -b</b></kbd> causes this copy's processes to be bound to the CPU specified by the expression that
                  follows it.  See the config file used in the run for the exact syntax, which tends to be cumbersome because of
                  the need to carefully quote parts of the expression.  When all expressions are evaluated, the jobs are typically
                  distributed evenly across the system, with each chip running the same number of jobs as all other chips, and each
                  core running the same number of jobs as all other cores.  </p>
               <p>The pbind expression may include various elements from the SPEC toolset and from standard Unix commands, such
                  as:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><kbd><b>$BIND</b></kbd>: a reference to a value from the bind line, a line of the form
                     "<tt>bind&nbsp;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;n&nbsp;n&nbsp;n</tt>", where each "n" is a processor number.  See <a
                        href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html#bind">http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html#bind</a>
                     for details on this feature.</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>$$</b></kbd>: the current process id</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>$SPECCOPYNUM</b></kbd>: the SPEC tools-assigned number for this copy of the benchmark.</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>psrinfo</b></kbd>: find out what processors are available</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>grep on-line</b></kbd>: search the <kbd>psrinfo</kbd> output for information regarding on-line cpus</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>expr</b></kbd>: Calculate simple arithmetic expressions.  For example, the effect of binding jobs to a
                     (quote-resolved) expression such as: <br /><tt>expr ( $SPECCOPYNUM / 4 ) * 8 + ($SPECCOPYNUM % 4 ) )</tt>
                     <br />would be to send the jobs to processors whose numbers are:
                     <br /><tt>0,1,2,3, 8,9,10,11, 16,17,18,19 ...</tt></li>
                  <li><kbd><b>awk...print \$1</b></kbd>: Pick out the line corresponding to this copy of the benchmark and use the CPU
                     number mentioned at the start of this line.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><kbd><b>sh dobmk</b></kbd> actually runs the benchmark.</li>

   <p>One or more of the following may have been used in the run.  If so, it will be listed in the notes sections.  Here

   <ul>

      <li><p><b><kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;directories&gt;</kbd></b>  (set via config file <tt>preENV</tt>)
            <br />LD_LIBRARY_PATH controls the search order for libraries.  Often, it can be defaulted.  Sometimes, it is
            explicitly set (as documented in the notes in the submission), in order to ensure that the correct versions of
            libraries are picked up.  </p></li>
      <li><p><b><kbd>OMP_STACKSIZE=N</kbd></b> (set via config file <tt>preENV</tt>)

      <p>The switch <tt>-funsafe-math-optimizations</tt> allows the compiler to make certain(*) aggressive assumptions, such as
         disregarding the programmer's intended order of operations. The run rules allow such re-ordering <a

            http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#reordering</a>.  The rules also point out that you must get answers
         that pass SPEC's validation requirements.  In some cases, that will mean that some optimizations must be turned off.
      </p>
      <p><tt>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</tt> turns off these(*) optimizations.  You may need to use this flag in order to get
         certain benchmarks to validate.  Note that this is an <i>optimization</i> switch, not a portability switch.  If it is
         needed, then in base you will need to use it consistently.  See: <a

   Whether the loop array prefetch pass should issue software prefetch hints for strides that are non-constant. In some cases this may be beneficial, though the fact the stride is non-constant may make it hard to predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these hints.
